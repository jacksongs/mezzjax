SKELETON MEZZANINE APP FOR HEROKU

Serves static files direct from Heroku and offers media library on S3.

Once installed, run 'heroku run python manage.py createdb' to create tables and superuser.

You will also need to determine the AWS credentials for heroku as per https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3.

Replace 'hellomezz' in the settings.py file with the name of your own AWS S3 bucket.

I'm a total noob and this took me about 6 hours to get up.
